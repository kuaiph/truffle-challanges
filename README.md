# Truffle challenges

These examples are part of my guide [The best way to become Ethereum Developer in 2018](https://medium.com/@pbrudny/the-best-way-to-become-ethereum-solidity-developer-in-2018-5606e54646e6)

and `30/30 challenge` on [polish ethereum programming](https://www.facebook.com/groups/531936723867447/?ref=bookmarks) FB group (members write one contract a day to improve Solidity skills).

First 11 Solidity challenges without Truffle are [here](https://github.com/pbrudny/learning-solidity-2018)

In Ethereum world everything is changing dynamically.
I decided to make a set of Smart Contracts for learning purposes.

I know it's funny to name a repo this way but I am quite convinced that in 2019 these examples may not work with the latest Solidity.

Try to write a contract yourself before checking the code in the repo!

## Examples

### 012_string_converter.sol
* create function to convert string to bytes32
* add Solidity test for that function
